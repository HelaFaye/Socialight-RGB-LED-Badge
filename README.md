Socialight-RGB-LED-Badge
========================

An ATTiny85 based badge that changes color in response to it's proximity to others

RGBRand.py is a program to make sure that my current idea for how to change the badge color wont produce one solid "mean"
color (my friend thought it might).

More details will be written here once I have them worked out a little.
